# [Case Study] Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025: A Feasibility Analysis via Standard Block Comparison

## 1. Introduction
The Osaka-Kansai Expo, scheduled for 2025, is a national project in Japan with a massive budget and ambitious visitor targets. However, there is growing skepticism regarding its feasibility and economic rationale.
This report analyzes the official projections using the **"Standard Block Comparison Method (SBCM)"** to strip away the "magic of large numbers" and reveal the logistical reality.

**Constants used in this analysis (based on `config.py`):**
*   **Total Population ($P$):** 124,000,000
*   **Total Municipalities ($N$):** 1,718
*   **Standard Block Population ($B_{std}$):** $124,000,000 \div 1,718 \approx \mathbf{72,176}$

## 2. Analysis by Standard Block Comparison

### Metric 1: Visitor Target (28.2 Million People)
The government aims for 28.2 million visitors over a 6-month period. Let's break this down to the "Per Standard Block (Municipality)" burden.

*   **Announced Figure ($V$):** 28,200,000 visitors
*   **Total Municipalities ($N$):** 1,718
*   **Burden per Block:** $\frac{28,200,000}{1,718} \approx \mathbf{16,414} \text{ people/municipality}$

**Analysis:**
To achieve this target, **every single municipality in Japan**—from snowy Hokkaido to the islands of Okinawa—must mobilize an average of **16,414 people** to travel to Osaka.
For a rural town with a population of 5,000, this means every resident must visit the Expo more than **3 times**. This projection ignores geographical barriers and travel costs, relying heavily on unrealistic repeat visits from locals.

### Metric 2: Construction Cost (235 Billion JPY)
The venue construction cost has ballooned to approximately 235 billion JPY (approx. $1.5 billion USD). Since this is funded by taxes (national and local) and the business sector, it represents a drain on national resources.

*   **Announced Figure ($V$):** 235,000,000,000 JPY
*   **Total Municipalities ($N$):** 1,718
*   **Cost per Block:** $\frac{235,000,000,000}{1,718} \approx \mathbf{136,786,961} \text{ JPY}$

**Analysis:**
This is equivalent to every municipality in Japan donating **approx. 137 million JPY ($900k USD)** to build temporary pavilions on an artificial island.
For many local governments facing depopulation, this amount could renovate a school or fund a year of child welfare services. The ROI (Return on Investment) for local communities outside Osaka is practically non-existent.

### Metric 3: Logistical Capacity (Daily Traffic)
Using the method to divide by "Time" instead of "Space":

*   **Total Visitors ($V$):** 28,200,000
*   **Duration:** 184 days
*   **Required Daily Average:** $\frac{28,200,000}{184} \approx \mathbf{153,261} \text{ people/day}$

**Analysis:**
The venue is located on "Yumeshima," an artificial island with limited rail and road access.
*   **Comparison:** Tokyo Disneyland's average daily attendance is approx. 50,000–70,000.
*   **Reality:** The Expo plans to transport **2 to 3 times the population of Disneyland** into a logistical cul-de-sac every single day for six months. This suggests a high risk of transportation paralysis or, more likely, a failure to meet the visitor target.

## 3. Conclusion
When analyzed through the lens of the Standard Block Comparison Method, the Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025 reveals critical flaws:

1.  **Unrealistic Mobilization:** The visitor target assumes a nationwide mobilization level (16,414 people per municipality) that defies geographical and economic reality.
2.  **Resource Misallocation:** The construction cost per municipality (137 million JPY) represents a significant opportunity cost for local welfare and education.
3.  **Logistical Risk:** The daily traffic requirement (153k/day) exceeds the capacity of typical theme park infrastructure, let alone a temporary island venue.

The "Standard Block" analysis suggests that these figures are not based on demand forecasting but are **"political numbers"** created to justify the budget.
